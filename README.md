# A SPA exported from Sapper
Hello! These files are the exported result of my other (_much_ more interesting) [sapper-tailwind-blog](https://github.com/badgrenola/sapper-tailwind-blog) repo. 

You can [see it in action here](https://mattbrealey.com), but you should probably head over to that other repo to find out what's actually going on 👍

Cheers!
